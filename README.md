### Hi there, I am Xiao Qinfeng (è‚–é’¦å³°)! ðŸ‘‹

#### ðŸ”­ I'm currently a machine learning engineer at XiaoMi Inc. I received my Master degree from the Department of Computer Science, [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://en.bjtu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Jing Wang](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=GIbxn34AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). My research interests include **Anomaly Detection**, **Self-supervised** / **Unsupervised Learning** and **Deep Learning Methods for Physiological Time-series**. Recently I am focusing on *learning semantic representations for physiological time-series*.

#### ðŸŒ± My research interests include:
- Anomaly Detection
- Temporal Data Mining
- Unsupervised Learning
- Self-supervised Learning (for Physiological Time-series)
