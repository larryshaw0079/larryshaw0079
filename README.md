### Hi there, I am Xiao Qinfeng (肖钦峰)! 👋

#### 🔭 Short Bio:
I am currently a Phd candidate of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU), supervised by [Prof. Kit Lun Yick](https://www.aidlab.hk/en/people-detail/prof-kit-lun-yick) in [AiDLAB](https://www.aidlab.hk/en/). Before that, I was a machine learning engineer at XiaoMi Inc. I received my Master degree from the Department of Computer Science, [Beijing Jiaotong University](http://en.bjtu.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Jing Wang](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=GIbxn34AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). My research interests include **3D Vison**, **Anomaly Detection**, **Self-supervised** / **Unsupervised Learning** and **Deep Learning Methods for Physiological Time-series**. Recently I am focusing on *learning semantic representations for physiological time-series*.

#### 🌱 My research interests include:
- 3D Vision
- Anomaly Detection
- Temporal Data Mining
- Unsupervised Learning
- Self-supervised Learning (for Physiological Time-series)
